The goal of this is a simple java application to provide a basic json interface
to an NBIA server.

Development Instructions
------------------------
To work on this tool, two sets of libraries are required: NBIAClient from the
caGRID folks and jargs. The locations to get those are below.

Build jargs from git://github.com/purcell/jargs.git (git repo, this has to built from source)

Once you have these jars, simply drop them into a folder called lib in the same directory as this
readme file and you should be all set. I did the development in Eclipse (HELIOS), so that should 
work out of the box. However, I'm also a big fan of using the command line so I'm supporting an
ant build file. If that doesn't make everybody happy, I don't know what will. Let me know if you
need any help building or using this thing. I'm a programmer not a technical writer, so every
effort will be made to improve the documentation.
