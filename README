The goal of this is a simple java application to provide a basic json interface
to an NBIA server.

Development Instructions
------------------------
To work on this tool, three sets of libraries are required: NBIAClient from the
caGRID folks, castor, jargs, and google-gson. The locations to get those are 
below.

https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/frs/download.php/9090/nbia_grid_client-jars-full_5.0.zip
Build jargs from git://github.com/purcell/jargs.git (git repo, this has to built from source)
http://dist.codehaus.org/castor/1.3.1/castor-1.3.1.zip
http://google-gson.googlecode.com/files/google-gson-1.6-release.zip

Once you have these jars, simply drop them into a folder called lib in the
same directory as this readme file and you should be all set. I did the 
development in Eclipse (HELIOS), so that should work out of the box. However,
I'm also a big fan of using the command line so I'm supporting an ant build
file. If that doesn't make everybody happy, I don't know what will. Let me
know if you need any help building or using this thing. Finally, I'm a
programmer not a technical writer, so every effort will be made to improve the
documentation.
